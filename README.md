The objective of this project is to optimize the cost of EC2 instance in the production environment by automating the start and stop of EC2 instance to enable it to run only when needed (during working hours,8am-10pm).This solution is ideal for predictable document processing workloads such as documents that require processing during regular business hours such as generating invoices for customers or processing payment transactions , generating contract documents, sending notification to stakeholders and last but not the least, automating the generation of daily reports or websites.
This project is a cross-account AWS architecture where the serverless service providerâ€™s account hosts a lambda function that automatically starts or stops an EC2 instance in the client account on a scheduled basis. 
Workflow
The Lambda function, stored in an S3 bucket in the Serverless Service Provider's account, is triggered by Amazon EventBridge on a cron schedule. To manage EC2 instances in the client's account, the Lambda function assumes an IAM role using Security Token Service (STS), gaining temporary permissions to control the instances, enabling secure, automated cross-account management.
The architecture was implemented using AWS Serverless Application Model where a template.yml file was used to define the components of the infrastructure thereby , streamlining  the lambda deployment process by minimizing  errors during deployment.
