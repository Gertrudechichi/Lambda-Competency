EC2 Instance Cost Optimization Project 🚀

Overview 📄

This project aims to optimize the cost of EC2 instances in production environments by automating their start and stop times ⏰. By leveraging a serverless architecture, EC2 instances will only run during working hours (8am-10pm), reducing unnecessary costs 💸.

Use Cases 📝

- Document processing workloads with predictable schedules 📅
- Generating invoices for customers 📨
- Processing payment transactions 💳
- Creating contract documents 📄
- Sending notifications to stakeholders 📣
- Automating daily reports or website updates 🤖

Architecture 🏗

- Cross-Account AWS Architecture: A Lambda function in the serverless service provider's account controls EC2 instances in the client account 📈
- Scheduled Automation: Amazon EventBridge triggers the Lambda function on a cron schedule ⏰
- Secure Cross-Account Management: The Lambda function assumes an IAM role using STS to gain temporary permissions 🔒

Implementation 💻

- AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM): Used to define infrastructure components in a template.yml file 📄
- Streamlined Deployment: SAM minimizes errors during deployment 🚀

Benefits 🎉

- Cost Optimization: Reduce EC2 instance costs by automating start and stop times 💸
- Increased Efficiency: Automate document processing workloads during regular business hours ⏰
- Secure and Scalable: Leverage AWS services for secure and scalable architecture 🔒
